// Here's some review on how to use Boolean Expressions + if, elif, else statements
// In this example, the user is told to make a Calculator to change the weight of a charecter based on the planet they're located on. 
// Based on the planet they're on, the charecter will be a different weight. 

print("I have information for the following planets: ")

print("   1. Venus   2. Mars    3. Jupiter")
print("   4. Saturn  5. Uranus  6. Neptune")
 
weight = 185
planet = 3

# Write an if statement below:

if planet == 1: 
  print(weight * 0.91)
elif planet == 2: 
  print(weight * 0.38)
elif planet == 3: 
  print(weight * 2.34)
elif planet == 4: 
  print(weight * 1.06)
elif planet == 5: 
  print(weight * 0.92)
else:
  print(weight*1.19)
