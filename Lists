// In the Python3 Course, we're taught how to make lists using this simple code:

variable = [1, 2, 3, 4]

sam_height_and_testscore = ["Sam", 67, 85.5, True]

// You can make a list with all the different types of data in Python (string, integer, float, boolean)

// CodeAcademy Tells Us: A list begins and ends with square brackets ([ and ]).
// Each item (i.e., 67 or 70) is separated by a comma (,)
// Itâ€™s considered good practice to insert a space () after each comma, but your code will run just fine if you forget the space.

// Append & Delete are used to either Add or remove data at the end of a list. 

example_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
example_list.remove(5)
print(example_list) 

// The program above will delete 5 from the list.

example_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
example_list.append(5)
print(example_list)

// The program above will add the number 5 to the list.
