// How to get User Input

Variable = input("Ask a question relating to Variable")

^ This is the most basic way to get input from a user that involves naming a variable, getting input for that variable 
and then inputting a string to ask the user a question regarding that variable. 

In Example: 

user_Favorite_Fruit = input("What's your favorite fruit?")

When this code is ran, a promt will pop up and ask the user "What's your favorite fruit" and the user can repsond with a string. 
After the user submits this answer, the variable user_Favorite_Fruit will now equal their string response.

Side Note: Make sure to use ("") when asking questions because usually, an apostrophy will be in the question in which
will cause a syntaxError when ran.
